The software documented on these pages is developed for the analysis of calometer signals in A\+T\+L\+AS. The input data are tuples extracted from the x\+A\+OD files described in \href{https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/AtlasSandboxProtected/CaloTowerPerformance}{\tt calorimeter tower performance twiki} (accessible for registered A\+T\+L\+AS user only).\hypertarget{index_m0}{}\section{Input data}\label{index_m0}
The tuples contain three calorimeter signal definitions for each event. The clusters of topologically connected cells ( {\itshape topo-\/cluster} ) are described in \href{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140%2Fepjc%2Fs10052-017-5004-5}{\tt this public paper}. They are the standard calorimeter signals used in A\+T\+L\+AS.

The two alternative signal definitions are calorimeter towers in a regular $ (\eta,\phi) $ grid. They are filled with cells from the topo-\/clusters ( {\itshape topo-\/tower} ). The grid sizes considered are $ \Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi = 0.1\times 0.1 $ and $ \Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi = 0.05\times 0.05 $.\hypertarget{index_m1}{}\section{Common codebase}\label{index_m1}
